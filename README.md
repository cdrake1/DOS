# drakeOS
drakeOS is my first Operating System build using TypeScript and [this 6502 instruction set.](https://www.labouseur.com/commondocs/6502alan-instruction-set.pdf) A simple definition of an Operating System is "A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware." This OS build will be separated into four sections denoted by Project 1, Project 2, and so on. After creating this repo and the name of my OS I realized DOS is already taken... SO I ended up changing it to... drakeOS!
